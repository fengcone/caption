给你一千美金让你送点文件 真的假的?
You get paid a thousand dollars for delivering paperwork, really?

I don't know, it takes me 10 minutes and they're paying a grand and the rest is none of my business.

It's paperwork! It's probably just some designs they swept so they can copy them.

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,310
这国家就是这样
That's how it works in this country.

I can't believe you did this to me.

73
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,890
- 我在这一动不动 我向你保证  - 你的保证连个屁都不值!
- I'll be right here, you have my word.  - Your word isn't worth shit!

74
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,860
呃... 值五百块 提前支付
Uh... it's worth 500 bucks, upfront.

Please tell him that I haven't done anything. I don't know anything.

00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,000
张先生想知道箱子里装的是什么
Mr. Jang wants to know what's in the case.

120
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,490
我不知道里面是什么 你到底会不会说英语?!
Well, I don't know what's in the case. Do you speak English or don't you speak English?!

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,720
我会! 我在纽约的一所国际高中里读过一年书
Yes, I do! I studied one year at International High School in New York.

122
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,870

What's really in here?

不是危险的东西
Nothing dangerous.

129
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,660
那他怎么不自己开?
So why won't he open it himself?

130
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,840
他不信任理查德先生
He doesn't trust Mr. Richard.

131
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,290
我也不信任理查德
I don't trust Richard either.

132

我只和他谈了一星期的恋爱
I only dated him for a week.

133
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,600
行! 行! 行!
OK! OK! OK!

- 张先生执意要你打开箱子  - 行! 行!
- Mr. Jang insists that you open the case.  - OK! OK!

135
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,000
上帝啊 救救我
Please God, help me.

136
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,000
他让你利索点 张先生还有要事缠身
He wants you to hurry up, Mr. Jang has other things to do.

137
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,600
你可不可以描述一下箱子里的东西?
Can you describe the content of the case?

138
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,830
是四个塑料袋 里面装着蓝色的粉末像是...
It's 4 plastic pouches filled with blue powder like a...

139
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,020
或许是紫色的粉末? 我不知道 看起来挺恶心
or maybe a purple powder? I don't know, it looks gross.

140
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,860
张先生想给你一份工作
Mr. Jang wants to offer you a job.

141
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,010
工作?

我不想要工作!
I don't want a job!

143
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,090
生命起源于大约十亿年前
If life starts approximately a billion years ago,

144
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,490
我们得在四十万年后
we'll have to wait 400,000 years

145
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,560
才能看到第一波神经细胞演变出来
to see the aberration of the first nerve cells.

146
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,640
这就是我们说的生命的起点
This is where life we know it begins.

147
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,240
从这些只有几毫米长的脑组织中
Brains in formation of only a few milligrams

148
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,350
我们无法断定 是否有智慧的存在
is not possible to determine any sign of intelligence yet.

149
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,910
它表现得更像反射作用
It acts more as a reflex.

150
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:17,700
一颗脑细胞 你活着 两颗脑细胞 你动着
One neuron, you're alive. Two neurons, you're moving.

151
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,550
而一旦有了活动 就会出现有趣的事情
And with movement, interesting things begin to happen.

152
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,530
数百万年前地球上就出现了动物
Animal life on Earth goes back millions of years.

153
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:36,000
然而 大多数物种只使用了大脑的百分之三到五
Yet, most species only use 3-5% of its cerebral capacity.

154
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,900
可是 只有成为人类 达食物链顶端的时候 
But it isn't until we reached human beings at the top of the animal chain,

155
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,680
我们才终于发现一种物种更多地使用了其脑容量
that we finally see a species used more of its cerebral capacity.

156
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,380
百分之十看似不多 但要是从人类用它所做的一切来看 已经很多了
10% may not seem like much but it's a lot if we look at all we've done with it.

157
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,730
现在我们来谈论一个特例
Now let's discuss a special case.

158
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:35,330
唯一一种比我们更好地利用大脑的生物...
The only living being that uses its brain better than us...

159
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,760
海豚
the dolphin.

160
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,420
据估计 这种不可思议的动物
It's estimated that this incredible animal

161
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,800
可以利用到大脑的百分之二十
uses up to 20% of its cerebral capacity.

162
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:52,390
尤其在于 这使它拥有着一种回声定位系统
And in particular, this allows it to have an echo-location system

163
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:57,110
比任何人类所发明的声纳系统都更加有效
that's more efficient than any sonar invented by mankind.

164
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,740
但是海豚并没有发明声纳 它是自然形成的
But the dolphin did not invent the sonar. It developed it naturally.

165
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,040
而这就是我们今天的哲学探讨中
And this is the crucial part of our

166
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,100
最具有关键性的环节
philosophical reflection we have today.

167
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,140
我们是否能够得出这样的结论
Can we therefore conclude

168
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,540
即人类更在意
that humans are concerned more with

169
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,270
"拥有"
"having"

170
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,340
而不是"具有"
than "being".

171
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,370
露西
Lucy.

172
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,990
你对我的腹部做了些什么?
What did you do with my stomach?

173
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,190
没什么! 只是一个小小的水平切口 刀工非常利落
Nothing! Just a little horizontal slit. It's very well done

174
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,780
一个月之后你会看到 疤痕基本就消失了
and you'll find that in a month, this scar is practically invisible too.

175
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,590
明年夏天你就能去海滩秀你的小蛮腰了
You'll be able to show your tummy off on the beach next summer.

176
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,720
我不在乎有没有疤
I don't care about the scar.

177
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,260
是不是 呃... 是不是我们为什么给你开刀?
Is it, uh... is it why we opened you up?

178
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,870
你放心 我们没有取你的器官什么的
Rest assured, we didn't harvest your organs or anything.

179
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,720
我们只是在你小腹里面放了个小包裹
Uh, we merely slipped a little package in your lower tummy.

180
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,700
它是... 一种新毒品 欧洲的孩子们会爱上它的 相信我
It's a... it's a new drug the kids in Europe are gonna love, believe me.

181
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:57,100
- 到底是什么?  - 学名叫做CPH4
- What is it?  - Well, the scientific term is CPH4,

182
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,760
从销售方面来看名字的确不是很诱人
which is not very sexy from a sale's point of view.

183
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,760
所以呃... 我们... 我们还在想时髦一点的名字...
So, uh... we're... we're still working on something a little bit more pop...

184
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,990
你有没有建议?
Any suggestions?

185
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,720
请稍等
Excuse me.

186
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,940
欢迎
Welcome.

187
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,510
欢迎 请进 很好 哎呦...
Welcome, come on in. Lovely, oops...

188
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,900
很不错! 很不错!
Splendid! Splendid!

189
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,410
真是不可思议! 很好很好!
Marvelous! Lovely lovely!

190
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,800
- 你还好吗?  - 我很好 亲爱的
- How are you?  - Very good, my dear.

191
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,270
好
OK.

192
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:33,140
这个 呃... 首先 非常感谢各位参与此次的计划
Right, uh... first of all, many thanks for taking part in this enterprise

193
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,780
我相信一定会完美完成任务
which I'm sure will go off flawlessly.

194
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,070
这些护照和机票呢
These lovely passport and tickets

195
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,570
可以让你在接下来的二十四小时内重返家园
will enable you to return home in the next 24 hours.

196
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,630
那么 当你到达的时候 会有我们的人接应你
Now, upon arrival, you'll be taken in hand by our people

197
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,530
这样我们才可以收回我们的货
so that we might recover our merchandise

198
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,810
而你们则可以重新获得那千辛万苦挣来的自由
and you might re-discover the freedom which you so richly deserve.

199
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,680
相信你们无需提醒 不过你们之中那些试图
I'm sure I don't need to remind you but, for any of those who may be tempted to

200
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,610
警告或者把自己交给警方的人呢
warn or turn themselves in to the authorities,

201
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:09,580
我们手上有你所有家属的姓名和住址 包括你的三姑六婆八大爷
we have the names and addresses of the families of every one of you down to the distant cousins.

202
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:15,660
所以我们相信你们会慎重行事
So, we rely therefore, on your complete discretion.

203
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,110
很好 那么 呃...
Good, anyway, uh...

204
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:22,030
先生们 和女士 请让我作为第一个祝福你们的人
gentleman, madam, allow me to be the first to wish you

205
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,870
一路顺风!
bon voyage!

206
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,460
哎呦!
Oops!

207
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,540
你们要卖这东西?
You gonna sell this?

208
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,650
恐怕这就是我们的商业模式
I'm afraid it's our business model.

209
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,510
对于我们这种原始生物来说 生命似乎只有一个目的
For primitive beings like us, life seems to only have one single purpose.

210
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,130
获得时间
Gaining time.

211
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,140
而花费时间 似乎也正是
And its going through time, seems to be also the only

212
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,850
我们体内每个细胞的真正和唯一的目的
real purpose of each of the cell in our bodies.

213
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,830
为了达到这个目标 那堆
To achieve that aim, the mass of the cells

214
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:00,000
能组成包括蚯蚓和人类的细胞
that make up earthworm and human beings

215
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,800
只有两种方法
has only 2 solutions:

216
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,650
长生不老...
be immortal...

217
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,800
或是繁衍后代
or to reproduce.

218
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:11,460
若它们的栖息之地不适合繁殖后代
If its habitat is not sufficiently favourable or nurturing,

219
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,150
细胞则会选择长生不老
the cell will choose immortality.

220
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,880
换句话说 自给自足以及自主管理
In other words, self-sufficiency and self-management.

221
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,440
另一方面 若栖息之地及其有利
On the other hand, if the habitat is favourable,

222
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,460
它们会选择繁殖
they will choose to reproduce.

223
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,090
这样一来 它们死的时候
That way, when they die,

224
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,340
会传递必要的信息和知识给下一个细胞
they hand down essential information and knowledge to the next cell

225
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,770
然后再传递给下一个细胞 以此类推
which hands it down to the next cell and so on.

226
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,770
因此 知识和学问
Thus, knowledge and learning

227
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,860
都是通过时间而传承的
are handed down through time.

228
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,660
好 好 保持冷静...
OK, OK, keep calm...

229
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,060
你必须等待 拖延时间
You have to wait, just play for time...

230
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,650
在飞机上你会有时间想办法的... 先上飞机
You'll have time to think it through on the plane... just take the flight,

231
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,690
先上飞机 离开这里
take the flight, get out of here.

232
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,360
这是最主要的 争取时间
That's the main thing right now, just save time.

233
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,350
什么都别干 保持冷静 你还活着...
Don't try anything, keep your cool, you're alive...

234
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,100
你还活着... 你还活着 只有这是重要的
you're alive... you're alive, that's all that matters.

235
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,840
等待 争取时间
Just wait, save time.

236
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,301
争取时间
Save time.

237
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:10,849
老娘我没心情
I'm not in the mood.

238
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,270
我们稍微设想一下
Let's imagine for a few moments

239
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:13,930
要是可以启用我们大脑的百分之二十的话
what our life would be like if we could access, let's say,

240
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:17,260
我们的生命会是什么样子
20 % of our brains' capacity.

241
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:22,030
这第一阶段会使我们能够了解并控制
This first stage would give us access to and control

242
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,880
我们的身体
of our own body.

243
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,930
- 先生  - 请说?
- Sir.  - Yes?

244
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,850
这被科学证实了吗?
Has it been proven scientifically?

245
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,700
哦 目前来说 我承认这只是假设
Oh, for the moment, it's just hypothesis, I confess.

246
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,830
但是你想想看
But if you think about it,

247
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:38,660
早在显微镜被发明几百年前 古埃及人 古希腊人和古印度人
it's troubling to realize that the Greeks, the Egyptians and the Indians

248
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:43,460
就意识到了"细胞"的存在 这是个让人不安的事实
had notion of "cells" centuries before the invention of the microscope.

249
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,440
再看看达尔文
And what to say about Darwin

250
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,600
当他提出进化论的时候 他遭到了所有人的嘲笑
whom everybody took for a fool when he put forward his Theory of Evolution.

251
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,870
如今需要我们来有所突破
It's up to us to push the rules and laws

252
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,390
从"进化"走向"革命"
and go from "evolution" to "revolution".

253
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,400
平均每人有一千亿个神经元
100 billion neurons per human,

254
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,300
其中被运用的只有15%
of which only 15% are activated.

255
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:09,220
人体内各部分之间的联系比银河中的恒星还要多
There're more connections in the human body than there're stars in the galaxy.

256
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,730
我们拥有一个无比庞大的信息网络
We possess a gigantic network of information

257
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:16,230
但是我们对它仍几乎一无所知
to which we've almost no access.

258
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,390
- 先生!  - 请说?
- Sir!  - Yes?

259
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,450
那下一阶段呢?
And what would be the next stage?

260
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:25,010
嗯 在下一阶段很可能会是控制他人
Well, the next stage would probably be control of other people.

261
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:30,660
但是要做到这一点 我们需要至少能使用大脑的百分之四十
But for that, we will need to access at least 40% of our brains' capacity.

262
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,390
在能控制自己和他人之后
And after control of ourselves and others,

263
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,080
就是控制物质
come control of matter.

264
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:41,180
但是这就完全是科幻小说了
But now we're entering the realm of science fiction.

265
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,070
对此 我们就像是犬狗望月一样一无所知
And we don't know anything more than a dog who watches the moon.

266
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,160
- 打扰下 先生  - 请说
- Excuse me, sir.  - Yes.

267
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,380
如果有人能使用其大脑百分之百的能力
But what would happen if for some reason we ignore

268
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:54,480
那会是怎样的?
somebody unlock 100% of the celebral capacity?

269
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,410
百分之百吗?
100%?

270
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,400
是的
Yes.

271
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,340
我真不知道
I've no idea.

272
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,230
嘿!
Hey!

273
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,470
- 嘿 你会说英语吗?  - 不 不 不
- Hey, you speak English?  - No. No. No.

274
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,020
- 你会说英语吗?  - 会 会
- You speak English? - Yes. Yes. 

275
00:30:52,122 --> 00:30:54,410
- 马上送我去医院  - 医院?
- Take me to the hospital now.  - Hospital? 

276
00:30:56,112 --> 00:30:57,310
我的腿!

277
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,560
- 医院  - 在这等我
- Hospital.  - Wait for me.

278
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,280
小姐 你好?
Miss, hello?

279
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,780
嘿 小姐!
Hey, miss!

280
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,010
我需要帮助 很紧急
I need help, it's urgent.

281
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,330
你不能进来 我们在做手术
You cannot be in here. We're operating.

282
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,410
请你出去!
Please, get out!

283
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,330
你们根本救不了他
You wouldn't be able to save him anyway.

284
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,350
肿瘤已经长到了他的大脑皮层和脊柱右侧
Tumour already invaded the cortext and right side of his spine.

285
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,790
有人在我身体里放了一袋毒品 我要你把它拿出来
Somebody put a bag of drug in me. I need you to remove it.

286
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,370
它漏了
It's leaking.

287
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,470
现在就做
Do it now.

288
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,100
好 我先给你局部麻醉...

不用了
Don't bother.

290
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,900
好吧 我.... 好的
Right, I... okay.

291
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:32,080
请冷静下 把枪放下来
Calm down, please. Put the gun down.

292
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,880
我先... 检查一下 好吗?
I'm just going to... examine, OK?

293
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,040
- 介意我用一下吗?  - 不介意
- Do you mind?  - No.

294
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,950
- 你好?  - 妈?
- Hello?  - Mom?

295
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,260
嘿 露西
Hey, Lucy.

我不知道 是晚上了

I'm back, you're not partying too much, are you?

302
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,710
你答应过我会照顾好自己

好吧 谢谢你能意外地打电话回来
Well, thanks for calling out of the blue like this.

305
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,600
你父亲错过了你的电话 肯定很难过

306

307
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,670

- Mom...  - Yes?

308
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,630
我感受到了一切
I feel everything.

309
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,980
你说什么 亲爱的?
What do you mean, sweatie?

310
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,030
空间
Space,

311
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,270
空气
the air,

312
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,100
振动
the vibrations,

313
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,200
还有人
the people.

314
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,510
我能感觉到重力
I can feel the gravity.

315
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,880
我能感觉到地球的转动
I can feel the rotation of the Earth.

316
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:00,960
身体的热量在消失
The heat leaving my body,

317
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,190
血管里的血液在流动
the blood in my veins,

318
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,860
我能感受到我的大脑
I can feel my brain.

319
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,930
我记忆的最深处
The deepest parts of my memory.

320
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:16,210
亲爱的 信号不好 我听不太清你在说什么
Sweatie, we've a bad connection, I can't hear you so well.

321
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,220
你说"记忆"怎么了?
What did you say about "memory"?

322
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,690
当我带上牙箍时 嘴里的疼痛 我...
The pain in my mouth, when I had braces, I ...

323
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:30,070
我记起我发烧时 你手摸我额头的感觉
I can remember the feeling of your hand on my forehead when I ran a fever.

324
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,310
我记得摸到猫的感觉 它真的很软
I remember stroking the cat. It was so soft.

325
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:37,330
猫? 什么猫 宝贝?
A cat? What cat, honey?

326
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,740
蓝眼睛 断了尾巴的那只暹罗猫
Siamese with blue eye and a broken tail.

327
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,460
亲爱的 你不可能还记得啊
Sweatie, you can't possibly remember that.

328
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,380
你那时候只有一岁大
You were barely a year old.

329
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:52,370
我记得吃奶的日子
I remember the days of your milk in my mouth,

330
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,890
那个房间
the room,

331
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,350
乳汁...
the liquid...

332
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,180
亲爱的 你在说些什么啊?
Sweatie, what are you talking about?

333
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,700
我想告诉你我爱你们 爸妈...
I just wanna tell you that I love you, Mom and Dad...

334
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,550
亲爱的...
Sweatie...

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,160
我想谢谢你们 因为...
And I wanna thank you for the...

336
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,190
你们无数次吻在我脸上的感觉我仍感受得到...
thousand kisses that I can still feel on my face...

337
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,230
我爱你 妈
I love you, Mom.

338
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,870
我也爱你 亲爱的
I love you too, sweatie,

339
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,140
胜过世间任何东西
more than anything in the world.

340
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,490
还剩多少?
How much is left?

341
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,080
五百克?
500 grams?

342
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,160
我身体还需要多少时间把其余的代谢掉?
And how long will it take for my body to eliminate the rest of it?

343
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:50,040
要回答这个问题 我得知道这是什么
To answer that, I need to know what it is.

344
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,480
可以吗?
May I?

345
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,650
继续吧
Go ahead.

346
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,340
是CPH4
CPH4.

347
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,420
告诉我
Tell me about it.

348
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,730
孕妇会在怀孕第六周的时候
Pregnant women manufacture CPH4 in the sixth week of pregnancy,

349
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,410
分泌微量的CPH4
in tiny quantities.

350
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:14,050
这给婴儿带来了相当于一颗原子弹的能量
For a baby, it packs the power of an atomic bomb.

351
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:19,510
这是胎儿生成骨骼结构所必需的能量
It's what gives the foetus the necessary energy to form all the bones in its body.

352
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,590
我听说有人试图人工合成
I've heard they tried to make a synthetic version of it.

353
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:25,190
没想到他们成功了
Didn't realize that they succeeded.

354
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,300
如果这真是CPH4
If it really is CPH4,

355
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,650
以这个量来说 我真惊讶你竟然还活着
in this quantity, I'm amazed you're still alive.

356
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,180
活不了多久
Not for long.

357
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,400
学习总是痛苦的
Learning is always a painful process.

358
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:46,870
就像你小的时候 你会因骨骼生长而全身疼痛
Like when you're little, your bones are growing and you ached all over.

359
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,280
你相信我能记得自己骨骼生长的声音吗?
Can you believe I can remember the sound of my own bones growing?

360
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,280
像这皮肤下磨得吱吱的声音
Like this grinding under the skin.

361
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,020
现在一切都不一样了
Everything is different now.

362
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:01,440
就比如... 我能理解音乐 就像流水...
Like... sound of music that I can understand, like fluids...

363
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,740
有趣的是我曾经满脑子想着
It's funny I used to be so concerned with

364
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,550
我是谁 我要成为什么样的人 还有...
who I was and what I wanted to be, and...

365
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:14,680
现在我能感受到我脑海的最深处 我看待事情清晰了 也明白了
now I've access to the furthest reaches of my brain, I see things clearly and realize

366
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,790
"我们"成为如今这样是有其原始原因的
what make us "us", it's primitive.

367
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,550
它们都是障碍物
They're all obstacles.

368
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,950
你能明白吗?
Does that make any sense?

369
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,340
就像你正在遭受的痛苦...
Like this pain you're experiencing...

370
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,790
它使你无法理解其它事物
is blocking you from understanding.

371
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,560
你知道的只有疼痛
All you know now is pain.

372
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,290
你只知道疼痛
That's all you know, pain.

373
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,630
其他人在哪里?
Where are the others?

374
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,820
其他带着毒品的人 我需要剩下的毒品
The others carrying the drugs. I need the rest of it

375
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,700
作医疗用途
for medicinal purposes.

376
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,260
柏林
Berlin.

377
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,700
巴黎
Paris.

378
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:29,450
罗马
Rome.

379
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,570
谢谢你的分享
Thank you for sharing.

380
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,090
- 晚上好 教授  - 我说过我会回来
- Oh, good evening, Professor.  - I sweared I'll be back.

381
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,530
你今晚没忘了用餐吧?
You hadn't forget your dinner tonight?

382
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:58,000
恐怕是的 我累坏了
I'm afraid so. I'm exhausted.

383
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
- 好好休息  - 谢谢
- Have a good rest.  - Thank you.

384
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,760
你吓死我了 这门敲得跟个神经病一样!
You scared the shit out of me. You ring that bell like some nut bar!

385
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,390
我想你啦!
I missed you!

386
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:14,830
我也是
Me too.

387
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,490
你丢了钥匙还是怎么?
You lose your key or something?

388
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,720
是啊
Yeah.

389
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,350
- 我能借你笔记本用下吗?  - 好的 没问题
- Can I borrow your laptop?  - Yeah, of course.

390
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,270
我去试镜试了一整天 太棒了
So I spent all day at this audition, awesome.

391
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,700
他们满口中文 就让你在那站一整天 因为他们根本就不在乎你的时间重不重要
They just have you standing around all day because they don't give a shit about your time, gabbing away in Chinese.

392
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,460
谁能听懂中文? 反正我是不懂
Who understand Chinese? I don't understand Chinese.

393
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,910
他们还说他们一定会有回信
And then they say they always gonna call

394
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,150
但是从不回信 他们都不记你的手机号码
and they never do. They don't even take your phone number.

395
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:41,880
你知道吧 除了一个男的 我觉着他... 他不是中国人
You know.Except this one guy, I bet he, uh...he's not Chinese.

396
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:45,600
他在那儿工作 很帅... 天啊 他真帅!
He works at the agency and he's cute... Oh my God, he's cute!

397
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,270

You know, like, the cute in kinda way, like he has this thing...

398
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,580
天啊 他的屁股...
Oh my God, his ass...

399
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,330
我们来说说这个!
Let me get started on that!

400
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:55,600
你肯定猜不到他带我去哪里了
And you'll never gonna guess where he take me.

401
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:01,050
四季酒店 皇家套房 我们一整晚都在滚床单
Four Seasons, Royal Suite, and we made love all night.

402
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,470
抱歉 光顾着说我了 你呢? 理查德怎么样?
I'm sorry, I'm talking about myself. What's up? How's Richard?

403
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,810
他死了
He's dead.

404
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,740
你们真疯 我去冲个澡
You guys are crazy. I'm gonna take a shower.

405
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:23,610
- 你好?  - 诺曼教授 我的名字叫露西
- Yes?  - Profesor Norman, my name is Lucy.

406
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:26,760
我看完了你有关人脑的所有研究 我们有必要见个面
I've just read all your research on the human's brain. We need to meet.

407
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,910
我所有的研究?
All of my research?

408
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:35,660
真是受宠若惊 小姐 但是这让人难以置信
Well, I'm very flattered, young lady. But I find that hard to believe.

409
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,320
我可写了整整...
I must have written no less than...

410
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:41,940
六千七百三十四页 我可以全部背出来了
6734 pages. I can recite them too all by heart if you wish.

411
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,540
你是艾米丽的朋友吗?
Are you one of Emily's friends?

412
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,660
这听起来真像她开的玩笑 她和你在一起吗?
This sounds like one of her silly jokes. Is she there with you?

413
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,350
不 只有我一个人
No, I'm on my own.

414
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,230
- 你是谁?  - 我刚告诉过你
- Who are you?  - I just told you.

415
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,240
露西 是吗? 是的 抱歉
Lucy, right? Yes, sorry.

416
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,620
我看了你有关大脑使用的理论
I read your theory on the use of the brain's capacity.

417
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,330
还有些粗糙 不过方向是对的
It's a little rudimentary but you're on the right track.

418
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,910
哦 谢谢
Oh, thank you.

419
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:14,130
教授 我的细胞正在以惊人的速度再生
Professor, my cells are reproducing at a phenomenal speed,

420
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,590
每秒几百万个
several millions per second,

421
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:19,050
我也无法精确估算我剩下的寿命
and I'm having trouble precisely evaluating the time of my death

422
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,620
但是我觉得不会超过二十四小时
but I doubt it'll last more than 24 hours.

423
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,110
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

424
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,360
我是说你的理论不只是理论
What I'm saying is that your theory is not a theory.

425
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,550
我吸收了大量人工合成的CPH4
I absorbed a large quatity of synthetic CPH4

426
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:33,940
可以让我百分之百地运用我的大脑
that would allow me to use 100% of my celebral capacity.

427
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,400
现在我的使用率到了百分之二十八 你写的是事实
Right now I'm at 28% and which you wrote is true.

428
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,440
一旦大脑使用了百分之二十 它会整个打开
Once the brain reaches 20% , it opens up and expands the rest

429
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,100
不会再有阻碍

就好像所有人类的特征都在慢慢消失
It's like all things that make us human are fading away.

448
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:55,870
当我越发感觉不像人类的时候

我不知道该怎么办

So if you're asking me what to do with all these knowledge you're accumalating, I'd say...

464
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,000

我看着手术

584
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:11,190
- 去弄点吃的来  - 你这个吃货

585
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,770
你平时都这么开车吗?
Do you always drive like that?

586
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:42,440
我以前没开过车
I never driven before.

587
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:43,820
真好
Great.

588
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:52,040
- 嘿 这是单行道!  - 我们要迟到了
- Hey, this is one way!  - We're late.

589
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:15,520
嘿 迟到总比没命好吧
Hey, I would rather be late than dead.

590
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,980
我们不会死的
We never really die.

591
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:09,700
抱歉 先生 我不同意...
Sorry, sir, I don't agree...

592
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:18,840
我没意见 
I'm fine, fine.

593
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:33,030
我要告诉他们别跟着我们
I'm going to tell them to stop following us.

594
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,190
不用麻烦了
Don't bother.

595
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:18,340
嘿 我给你买了...

596
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:58,240
把箱子给我
Give me the case.

597
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,260
杀了她 拿到毒品

598
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:20,940
别傻站着 杀了她!

599
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,930
打开
Open it.

600
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:24,850
我们走
Let's go.

601
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:27,520
我觉得我什么都帮不到你
I'm not sure I could be of any help for you.

602
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,500
不 你帮得到
Yes, you are.

603
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:35,310
怎么帮?
What for?

604
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:43,340
提醒我
A reminder.

605
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:45,480
可以走了吗?
Shall we go? 

606
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,940
我们去哪里?
Where are we going? 

607
01:05:14,942 --> 01:05:16,940
第一个路口左转
Take the first left.

608
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:19,950
好的
Okay.

609
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:37,710
跟上那辆车

610
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:43,290
- 教授?  - 谢谢
- Professor?  - Thanks.

611
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:44,920
- 你好?  - 我是露西
- Yes?  - Lucy.

612
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:46,670
是她 她打来了
It's her, it's her.

613
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:49,450
嘿 你好 你在巴黎?
Hey you, you're in Paris?

614
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:50,510
是的 我到了
Yes, I'm.

615
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:52,400
很好 很好 太好了
Good, good, excellant.

616
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:57,420
听着 我已经离开酒店了 来大学里了
So, look, I'm no longer at the hotel now, uh, I've come to the university

617
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:02,030
我已经请来几位同事一起讨论你的事情了
where I've taken the liberty of calling and gathering a few of my colleagues to discuss your case.

618
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,400
他们都是各自领域的精英... 可以信赖
Top men in their field and um... very trustworthy.

619
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:06,700
我相信你
I trust you.

620
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:10,300
噢 谢谢 那我们可以在学校见吗?
Oh, thank you. So, do you think you can meet us here at the university?

621
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:18,450
我... 我很高兴见到你
I'm, uh...I'm very pleased to meet you.

622
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:20,160
我也是
Likewise.

623
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,430
- 我是德·里奥警长  - 你好
- Captain Del Rio.  - How do you do?

624
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:27,170
我... 介绍同事给你认识
Let... let me introduce you to my colleagues.

625
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:29,840
这位是卡帝亚教授 脑外科医生
This is Professor Cartier, neuro surgeon.

626
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,570
- 教授...  - 所有人我都认识
- Professor...  - I know who everyone is.

627
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:34,750
啊 当然
Ah, of course.

628
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:39,110
嗯 先生们 这位是露西 第一个女人...
Uh, gentlemen, this is Lucy, the first woman to...

629
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:42,550
我想说... 我之前有介绍...
I mean... like I mentioned earlier...

630
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,500
露西小姐 因为某种对我来说还是个迷的原因 
Ms. Lucy has for reasons, remains a mystery to me,

631
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:50,330
她脑部的某些区域得到开发
unlocked certain portion of her brain

632
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:51,820
可以进入
that offered access

633
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:55,930
我们... 未知的某些领域
to... previously unexplored celebral zones.

634
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:59,550
她有超能力
She has abilities.

635
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:01,280
能给我们示范下吗?
Can you give us an example?

636
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:04,730
你的女儿 盖布里埃尔 六岁时死于车祸
Your daughter, Gabriel, aged 6, died in a car accident.

637
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,060
是辆蓝色轿车 皮座椅...
It was a blue car, leather seats...

638
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,520
后视镜上有只塑料小鸟挂饰
plastic bird hanging from the rear view mirror.

639
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:28,960
老大 我们有五个人死在医院 对不起

640
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,750
还剩多少人手?

641
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:34,270
我这边还有二十五人

642
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:37,440
该死的 她真顽强 她是个巫婆

643
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:42,660
我知道

644
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:46,080
我要亲手杀了她

645
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:52,820
有人要来了 你能守住这里吗?
There're men coming here, can you secure the room?

646
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:55,100
- 我需要集中注意力  - 好的
- I need to stay focus.  - Sure.

647
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,100
快点
Speed it up.

648
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:14,390
你如何掌握这些信息的?
How did you manage to access all these information?

649
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:16,210
电子脉冲...
Electrical impulses...

650
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:19,250
每个细胞都熟悉其他的细胞 并且相互交流
Every cell knows and talks to every other cell.

651
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:22,430
彼此间每秒钟交换一千比特信息
They exchange a thousand bits of information between them per second.

652
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:25,990
细胞们聚在一起 形成强大的通信网
Cells group together, forming a giant web of communication

653
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,040
然后构成物质
which in turn forms matter.

654
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:32,090
细胞们聚在一起 组成形态
Cells get together, take on one form,

655
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:34,350
变形 再重新组合
deform, reform,

656
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:36,750
本质上没什么不同 都是一样的
makes no difference, it's all the same.

657
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:39,470
人类认为自己独一无二
Human considers themself unique.

658
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:43,010
所以他们将人类存在的所有理论都植根于独特上
So, they rooted their whole theory of existence on their uniqueness.

659
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:46,350
"一"... 是衡量一切的标准 但其实不是
"One"... is the unit of measure but it's not.

660
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:49,530
所有的社交系统不过只是"草图"
All social systems we put into place are mere "sketch".

661
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:52,100
一加一等于二 这是我们唯一知道的
1 + 1 = 2 That's all we learned.

662
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:55,110
但一加一从来就不等于二
But 1 + 1 has never equalled 2.

663
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:58,560
事实上 没有所谓的数字或字母
They're in fact, no numbers and no letters.

664
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,060
我们把自己的存在用人类的概念去解释
We codify our existence to bring it down to human size

665
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:04,100
以便理解
to make it comprehensible.

666
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:09,040
我们创造了尺度 忘记其实一切变幻莫测
We created the scale so that we can forget its unfathomable scale.

667
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:14,820
但如果人类不是衡量的标尺
But if humans are not the unit of measure,

668
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:17,960
世界也不是由数学原理掌控的
and the world isn't governed by mathemathical laws,

669
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:20,640
谁来掌控一切?
what governs all that?

670
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,480
一辆车驶过路面...
Form a car speeding down the road...

671
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,100
加速这幅画面无穷快
speed up the image infinitely

672
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:29,560
车辆消失
and the car disappears.

673
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:35,800
所以 什么证明了我们的存在?
So, what proof do we have of its existence?

674
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:38,140
时间给我们存在合法性
Time gives legitimacy to its existence.

675
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:41,260
时间是衡量一切的标准
Time is the only true unit of meassure.

676
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:44,700
它证明物质的存在
It gives proof to the existence of matter.

677
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,270
没有时间
Without time,

678
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:49,020
我们都不存在
we don't exist.

679
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:57,050
时间才是"个体"
Time is "unity".

680
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:08,010
给我搜整个大楼 找到她!

681
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,330
我们撑不了太久的
We wouldn't be able to hold them for much longer.

682
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:16,140
那开始吧
Time to go then.

683
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:32,140
你确定要这么大剂量?
Are you sure you need such huge doses?

684
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,720
我怕你承受不了
I'm afraid you won't survive.

685
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:37,910
我身体里的一些细胞会誓死捍卫它们的完整性
Some cells inside me will fight and defend their integrity to the very end.

686
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:41,360
为了开发最后一部分 我必须逼迫它们
In order to attain the last few percent, I've to force it.

687
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,130
击破细胞 打开细胞核
To crack the cells open to their nucleus.

688
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,280
这些知识 露西...
All these knowledge, Lucy...

689
01:10:57,330 --> 01:11:00,320
我甚至不确定人类能否接受
I'm not even sure that mankind is ready for it.

690
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,950
我们被权势利益所驱使
We're so driven by power and profit.

691
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:05,370
鉴于人类本性
Given man's nature,

692
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,660
也许这只会给我们带来动荡和混乱
it might bring us only instability and chaos.

693
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:16,290
无知才导致混乱 不是知识
Ignorance brings chaos, not knowledge.

694
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,530
我会造一个电脑 把我所知的一切放在里面
I'll build a computer and download all my knowledge in it.

695
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,550
我会想办法把它给你
I'll find a way for you to have access to it.

696
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:24,380
好的
Yeah.

697
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:28,320
我希望你的牺牲是值得的
I just hope, we'll be worthy of your sacrifice.

698
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:39,970
不准动!
Nobody move!

699
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:59,120
能听懂英语吗?
Do you understand English?

700
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:02,530
她在干吗?
What is she doing?

701
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:05,330
她在寻找能量和物质
She's looking for energy and matter.

702
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:12,460
还在尝试连接我们的电脑
And she's trying to connect with our computers.

703
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:53,970
冲俊!

704
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:55,640
我在这里 老大!

705
01:13:55,730 --> 01:13:57,410
干掉他们

706
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:59,130
好的 老大!

707
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:02,120
你们 给我上

708
01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:04,470
好了吗?

709
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,510
你还好吗?

710
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,490
快找医生 快!

711
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:17,940
天啊 怎么回事?
Oh my God, what's happening?

712
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:30,230
她在做什么?
What's she making?

713
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:32,950
我猜是新一代的计算机
A new generation of computer, I presume.

714
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:53,650
她呢?

715
01:20:57,890 --> 01:20:59,430
她人呢?

716
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:00,680
回答我!

717
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:03,030
回答我!

718
01:21:03,490 --> 01:21:04,550
嘿 说你呢!
Hey, you!

719
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:23,920
看电脑 它在移动
Look, the computer, it's moving.

720
01:21:50,290 --> 01:21:51,560
嘿
Hey.

721
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:53,470
她去哪里了?
Where is she?

722
01:22:00,970 --> 01:22:02,960
我无处不在

723
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:25,260
十亿年前 我们被赐予了生命
Life was given to us a billion years ago.

724
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:28,070
现在你知道能用它做什么了
Now you know what to do with it.
